# Employee Payroll Tracker Project

In this project, I gained hands-on experience with several fundamental JavaScript concepts:

- **Methods**: Understanding how to define and use methods within functions and objects to encapsulate logic.
  -**Console.log**: Logs External files make your code organized and easier to maintain.
- **Scope**:
  - **Local Scope**: Using variables within specific functions or blocks to control their accessibility.
  - **Global Scope**: Managing variables and functions that are accessible throughout the entire script.
- **Function**
  -**Declarations and Expressions**: Differentiating between function declarations "function name() {}" and function expressions const name = function() {}" and their uses. 
  -**Functions** are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
  -**Parameters** Parameters give a name to the data to be passed into the function. Functions can take in parameters.
- **Objects**: Creating and managing objects to group related data and methods together.
- **Arrays**: Using arrays to store and manipulate lists of data, such as employee information.
- ** This Keyword**: Exploring the context of this within functions and objects to reference the current object or function scope.
- **Iteration**: Implementing for and while loops to iterate over arrays and perform repetitive tasks.
- **Conditional Statements**: Utilizing if and else statements to execute code based on specific conditions.
- **Variables**: Learned the difference between the three to determine declaring and using variables with var, let, and const to store and manage data.
